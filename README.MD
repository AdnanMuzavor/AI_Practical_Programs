### AI - Aritificial Intelligence Practical Programs

## Exp 01 : Breadth First Search on Given graph
- Exp 1 deals with finding the given key using **BFS** Traversal

## Exp 02 : Depth First Search on Given graph
- Exp 2 deals with finding the given key using **DFS** Traversal
- Variations: DFS giving **optimal path** only, DFS with **depth limit** and **Iterative** Depth limit DFS

## Exp 03 : Best First Search on Given graph
- Exp 3 deals with finding the given key using **Best FS** Traversal
- Best First Seartch is heuristic based search algoeithm where in at each each iteration,
  node is selected based on heuristic value **only**
- **Lower** the heuristic value ***h*** more chances of node getting selected.
