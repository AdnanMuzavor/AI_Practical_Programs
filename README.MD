### AI - Aritificial Intelligence Practical Programs

## Exp 01 : Breadth First Search on Given graph
- Exp 1 deals with finding the given key using **BFS** Traversal

## Exp 02 : Depth First Search on Given graph
- Exp 2 deals with finding the given key using **DFS** Traversal
- Variations: DFS giving **optimal path** only, DFS with **depth limit** and **Iterative** Depth limit DFS

## Exp 03 : Best First Search on Given graph
- Exp 3 deals with finding the given key using **Best FS** Traversal
- Best First Seartch is heuristic based search algoeithm where in at each each iteration,
  node is selected based on heuristic value **only**
- **Lower** the heuristic value ***h*** more chances of node getting selected.

## EXP 04: A* Search
- Exp 4 is based on Optimal Search algorithm which is used to find path with least cost from src to des
- It uses **f=g+h** where g is edge cost and h is heuristic associated with node to which edges goes from current edge

## EXP 05: Hill Climbing Algorithm
### 5.1: Travelling Salesperson Problem**
- Salesmen will follow the optimum path at each city whcih will either lead to **not so good** soln or **no soln**
### 5.2: 8- Puzzle Problem**
- Here given a **3 x 3** and initial state we have to move the **dash** inside to reach to the goal state.
